# E-Commerce Page
Project Overview
This project is a fully responsive e-commerce section built based on the provided Figma design. It dynamically renders product data and manages cart interactions using vanilla JavaScript without external frameworks.

Architecture
The application follows a modular, class-based structure to separate concerns between data management and UI rendering.

Product handling logic

Cart state management

UI rendering and DOM updates

Dynamic Data Rendering
Products are not hard-coded in the HTML. They are stored in a local JSON structure within the JavaScript file and rendered dynamically into the DOM on page load.

Cart Functionality
The “Add to Cart” feature updates a local cart state and reflects changes in the UI instantly, including cart count updates.

Frontend Implementation

Semantic HTML5 structure

CSS3 with responsive design

Mobile-first approach

Pixel-accurate implementation based on Figma

Code Quality

Clear and consistent naming conventions

Modular file structure

Efficient DOM manipulation

Event delegation for optimized performance
